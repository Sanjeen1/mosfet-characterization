# mosfet-characterization
Collection of MOSFET experiments (Id窶天g, Id窶天d, temperature effects and more) simulated in Ngspice for device behavior and VLSI research.

Mname Drain Gate Source Bulk ModelName [parameters...]

m1 vdd in 0 0 nfet l = 1u w = 0.5u

dc v_in 0 3.3 0.1 v_dd 0 3.3 1 --> This is often used in MOSFET characterization, where you want to see how the Id窶天g curve changes for different Vds values (Transfer characterisrtic).

dc v_dd 0 3.3 0.1 v_in 0 3.3 1 --> This setup gives you Id窶天d characteristics (output characterstic) at different gate voltages.

The above is Id vs Vd (outut characteristic) at gate voltage 0 1 2 3 (from bottom to top ) stepsize is 1.

The above is Id vs Vg (Transfer Characteristic) at drain voltage 0 1 2 3 (from bottom to top ) stepsize is 1.

##Threshold voltage effect -

When threshold voltage increase the drain current reduced as we can see according to current eqaution also.
